To-Do

Prettification Needed
- i dont want intersection to always show the event message that the intersection is quiet. I want it to only have a message when the robbery event is available

FINAL TO-DO
- do i hide old map_nodes.lua file? should i make an archive folder?
- get rid of duplicated or unused code
- add file headers and detailed comments
- add installation steps (populate readme)









------------------ Future Implementation Plans ------------------

General
- Uncomment out all the nodes
- Have a map
- save menu
- Can rolls from location to location? (or minigame with rolling for the highway)
- backyard will have a hose to polish your can? (but if pond hurts can then would hose?)
- add counterfiet soup seller --> should this be an event/encounter instead of a location and event/encounter
- sewer shortcuts
- add person coming to look at can event to the start

Additions
- the movers have a toolkit that can be used to fix your can to 100% health
- add man in trenchcoat to sketchy alley that you can trade your gold skin for a fire extinguisher

General
- decide what to put on inventory bar (on the right side)
- make inventory bar collapsable (use ravioli backpack item)
