To-Do

Prettification Needed
- Make dumpster, dumpster key, front door objects, and fire extinguisher, recycling bin
- add descriptions to nodes (make sure they dont overlap/repeat)

Bugs
- Fix warning in audio_manager.lua
- when the robbery event is happening i dont want the description box at the top to show, only after the robber is dealt with will it show up

FINAL TO-DO
- decide whether or not to get rid of commented nodes/make a new file for them or leave them as is
- get rid of duplicated or unused code
- add file headers and detailed comments










------------------ Future Implementation Plans ------------------

General
- Uncomment out all the nodes
- Have a map
- save menu
- Can rolls from location to location? (or minigame with rolling for the highway)

Additions
- the movers have a toolkit that can be used to fix your can to 100% health
- add man in trenchcoat to sketchy alley that you can trade your gold skin for a fire extinguisher

General
- decide what to put on inventory bar (on the right side)
- make inventory bar collapsable (use ravioli backpack item)
