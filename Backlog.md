To-Do

Prettification Needed
- Robbery interactible clicking boxes (add sprites and overlay with image?) (robber, and attendant sprites needed)
- Make dumpster, dumpster key, and front door objects, fire extinguisher
- finalize arrow positions (make sure an arrow is created in map_nodes for each location)
- Give front_door a pretty image
- add descriptions to nodes (make sure they dont overlap/repeat)

Bugs
- Fix warning in audio_manager.lua
- when the robbery event is happening i dont want the description box at the top to show, only after the robber is dealt with will it show up
- attendant image does not resize right away

FINAL TO-DO
- decide whether or not to get rid of commented nodes/make a new file for them or leave them as is
- get rid of duplicated or unused code
- add file headers and detailed comments

------------------ Icing on Top ------------------

Additions
- the movers have a toolkit that can be used to fix your can to 100% health
- add man in trenchcoat to sketchy alley that you can trade your gold skin for a fire extinguisher

General
- decide what to put on inventory bar (on the right side)
- make inventory bar collapsable (use ravioli backpack item)
