To-Do

Music
- Credit chef_music (Tetes Raides, un p'tit air)
- Change background music to trigger only when on I want it
- Add music/audio for robbery

Events
- the movers have a toolkit that can be used to fix your can to 100% health

General
- decide whether or not to get rid of commented nodes/make a new file for them or leave them as is
- once you unlock the front door and go into the living room, you can also exit out of the living room to the porch
- add man in trenchcoat to sketchy alley that you can trade your gold skin for a fire extinguisher
- add interaction for clicking on recycling bin of can, unlocks a blue mental health bar 
- descide what to put on inventory bar (on the right side)
- make inventory bar collapseable (use ravioli backpack item)
- add a gameover button that goes to the main menu after victory
- volume settings on main menu and accessible throughout the game via a settings menu (you will eventually be able to save on this menu)

Prettification Needed
- Robbery interactible clicking boxes (add sprites and overlay with image?) (robber, and attendant sprites needed)
- Make dumpster, dumpster key, and front door objects, fire extinguisher
- finalize arrow positions (make sure an arrow is created in map_nodes for each location)
- Give front_door a pretty image

Bugs
- The node name gets cut off if the arrow is too close to the edge of the screen
- At front_porch, there is a front_door item and an arrow to go to the living room, the arrow should only appear once the front door has been locked.
