To-Do

Prettification Needed


FINAL TO-DO
- get rid of duplicated or unused code
- add file headers and detailed comments
- add installation steps (populate readme)
- do i hide old map_nodes.lua file? should i make an archive folder?
- make sure game node starts at 1


Prompt:
- find duplicate or redundant code in this file compared to every other file to find lines or code blocks that could be deleted with no consequences, or replaced with helper functions (existing or new) to reduce repetition. 
- could/should this code file be more modular?
-add a file and description code block to the top and create new detailed comments throughout this file only

Redundancy:




------------------ Future Implementation Plans ------------------

General
- Uncomment out all the nodes
- Have a map
- save menu
- Can rolls from location to location? (or minigame with rolling for the highway)
- backyard will have a hose to polish your can? (but if pond hurts can then would hose?)
- add counterfiet soup seller --> should this be an event/encounter instead of a location and event/encounter
- sewer shortcuts
- add person coming to look at can event to the start
- add tool tips so players know when to click on something to learn game mechanics
- decide what to put on inventory bar (on the right side)
- make inventory bar collapsable (use ravioli backpack item)


Additions
- the movers have a toolkit that can be used to fix your can to 100% health
- add man in trenchcoat to sketchy alley that you can trade your gold skin for a fire extinguisher

General

Improve Modularity
- Add sprite images folder for hud and scene_renderer
- separate scener_renderer into smaller componnents so it doesnt do arrows, input, tooltips, and item rendering all in one place
